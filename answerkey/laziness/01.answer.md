The above solution will stack overflow for large lazy lists, since it's
not tail-recursive. Here is a tail-recursive implementation. At each
step we cons onto the front of the `acc` list, which will result in the
reverse of the lazy list. Then at the end we reverse the result to get the
correct order again.

/*
In order to avoid the `reverse` at the end, we could write it using a
mutable list buffer and an explicit loop instead. Note that the mutable
list buffer never escapes our `toList` method, so this function is
still _pure_.
